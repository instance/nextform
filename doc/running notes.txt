To Do List
- New tests for BS4 features, eg "button purpose" should be run by all render tests
- add tests for disabled, visible settings in the Element
- ^^^^ disable/visible settings handlers should be common code if possible.
- "proper" unit tests need attention.
- There are more test sets to iterate through (eg. large/small layouts)... strategy?
- Add a composite construct to assemble multiple items (texts, selects) into an input group
- Need checkboxes as switches (custom-control custom-switch)
- Create an input group when help/error labels exist and put the text inside the group
- working on simplifying options by allowing "label[:value]", this will simplify option lists.
- Rendering tests not testing default value
- Consider adding Bulma
- All the show() stuff is gross. It doesn't belong in Render\Html nor in a trait. Refactor.
- Add a html presentation type that is always static and not returned in the request.
- Multi-form support still needs need methods to get one form, just the scripts, etc.
