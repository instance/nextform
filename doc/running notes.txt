To Do List
- Flesh out unit tests for Renderer\Simple
- Alignment in text fields, radio, checkboxes.
- Implement render context push/pull
- Don't fold repetitive code for labels into functions just yet... we may want to add classes, etc.
- select fields need tests with labels, both vertical and horizontal
